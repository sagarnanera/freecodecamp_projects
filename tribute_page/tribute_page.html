            <h3 id="info1" class="content">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam ( 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an
                Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
                decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
                Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
                civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the
                Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
                He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear
                tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</h3>
            <h3 id="info2" class="content">Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of
                both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred
                to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public
                service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat
                Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</h3>
            <h3 id="info3" class="content">While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
                Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including
                national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he
                was buried with full state honours.</h3>
